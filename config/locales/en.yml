This archipelago, the largest of the Caribbean Antillean region, includes the Isle of Cuba, the Isle of Youth and some 4,195 keys and islets. Cuba is located at the entrance of the Gulf of Mexico. Descendants from Spaniards, Africans and Asians create a unique mixture that composes the local population, which is near 12 million residents. Nearly 3 million citizens live in the capital, Havana City, although there are other important cities in the isle like Santiago de Cuba, Camagüey, Holguín, Cienfuegos and Matanzas.</p>
                <p>Havana looks nowadays much as it was built centuries ago.Most of buildings stand today are the testimony of the Spanish colonial architecture of those times. Big '50s and '60s American vehicles still dominate the streets creating an unforgettable time traveling experience. Old Havana is the city's oldest section, which has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, in 1982. This old section includes valuable monuments like La Fuerza Fortress; La Cabaña Fortress and El Morro and La Punta castles, all of them designed to protect Old Havana from pirate attacks in colonial times.</p>
                <p>The Havana city, appointed recently as “Wonder City”, offers you a wide variety of places of historical, cultural, religious, architectural and artistic value. Havana’s nightlife is very hectic, with many cinemas, historic theatres, cabarets and nightclubs to choose. The colonial architecture, the Cuban traditional culture, and the kindness of Havana's people are the biggest appeals of the city.</p>"
